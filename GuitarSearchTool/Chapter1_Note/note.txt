Encapsulation: is when you hide the implementation of a class 
in such a way that it is easy to use and easy to change. It
makes the class act as a black box that provides a service to 
its users, but does not open up the code so someone can change
it or use it the wrong way. Encapsulation is a key technique 
in being able to follow the Open-Closed principle
Using Encapsulation to: 
- Protect information in your code bing used incorrectly
- Separate your data from your app's behavior. So you can 
control how each part is used by the rest of your application
